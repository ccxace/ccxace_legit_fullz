            <p>Now firstly I am not an expert 
coder and this is a makeshift site to expose scams, so don't worry about
 it looking basic, i don't give a shit I'm here to expose scams. So, 
            about a few months ago i got scammed thrice, on telegram and
 dark web. I was desperate for money coz i was getting kicked out of the 
house by my dad and needed quick money. I tried my luck and lost $200 in
 total, which might not be a lot for some of you but for me it was. Now, to straight to the point, like 99% of sites in 
dark web or channels in telegram are a SCAM, DO NOT BUY from them. They 
say shit like escrow, 'delivery within x many days', they give u 
'proofs' of names written on blank cards, they will make their website look 
attractive and shit. Yeah, everything is SCAM. U can order blank card 
and write names on them, anyone could do that. 
            The images they show to u is fake, all of them. The 
'reviews' you see on their website, that's by either by bots, or other 
scammers who are involved with each other. <br><br>WHY do the scammers do this ?&nbsp; <br><br>because its easy as fuck for desperate people to try for easy money. No one 
can track BTC transfer nor the scammers in darkweb, and the fkin scammers 
have absolutely no empathy. They would know they robbed money of someone
 who was gonna save it up for their dad's chemo, and they wouldn't care.
 Now if you got scammed before for clone cards or anything [drugs, 
weapons, hacker], take the L and move on. There is nothing u can do now,
 message the scammer all u want they won't reply. There's nothing good 
in beating yourself down coz of that, GUILT is the most useless emotion,
 and also realize u were tryna purchase clone card which is a scam too, 
so ur also involved in a scam. As for the scammers, fk u and i hope u 
die the most painful death possible and end up in hell.
        <br><br><br><br>Here is the official site of darkweb.wiki exposing all of the KNOWN scammers: <a href="https://darkweb.wiki/scam-list/" target="_blank">https://darkweb.wiki/scam-list/</a>.
 Look at the fuckin size of the list, and look at the amount of 
comments, most of them commenting about them getting scammed. No matter 
how much convincing their site looks, DO NOT BUY from them. U wanna get 
clone cards, DO IT YOURSELF. Buy a skimmer on aliexpress or amazon, buy 
blank cards, download deftun software compatible for ur device, do a 
shit ton of research first, and then start it. Realize that there's 
countless risks. It's not very hard to do it, u just need to be careful 
with it. I finally was able to do skimming and made some money. I'm 
gonna do it until i get money to afford rent and then quit it coz i have
 morals unlike the scammers. DO NOT message me trying to buy clone card i
 will not give u. Now in conclusion, DO NOT trust any service selling 
clone card or anything illegal because its ALL  a scam and its proven. 
Do it yourself. If u got scammed already, realize that u can do nothing 
about it now, and start working harder and earn the money u lost. <br></p>
